# Out-of-band channel for sending verification codes
# Options: telegram, slack, discord, email
channel: telegram

# Secret storage backend (auto-detected if not set)
# Options: keychain (macOS), pass (Linux), env (fallback)
storage: keychain

# Security level presets (legacy names still map automatically):
# - minimal: relaxed timings and lockout
# - low (default): recommended everyday profile
# - medium: tighter timeout/attempts
# - high: strongest non-destructive profile
# - extra_high: hard parent termination on failed verify
security_level: low

# Optional TOTP mode (Google Authenticator / Authy / 1Password):
# - off: challenge code only
# - fallback: use TOTP when no active challenge exists
# - required: verify via TOTP only
totp_mode: off

# Allowed clock drift in 30s steps (0-3). Default is 1 (±30s).
totp_window: 1

# Optional overrides (set only if you need custom tuning)
# Code expiry in seconds
# expiry: 300
# Code length in bytes
# code_length: 6
# Maximum failed verify attempts before lockout
# max_attempts: 3
# Failure behavior override
# - none: return FAILED and let caller enforce policy
# - terminate_parent: return FAILED, alert channel, and signal parent process
# fail_action: none

# Optional HTTP hardening for channel requests
# http_connect_timeout: 5
# http_max_time: 15
# http_retries: 2

# Channel-specific settings can go here, but credentials
# should be stored in your OS secret store (Keychain/pass),
# NOT in this file. Run `ai2fa setup` to configure securely.

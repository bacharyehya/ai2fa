# Out-of-band channel for sending verification codes
# Options: telegram, slack, discord, email
channel: telegram

# Secret storage backend (auto-detected if not set)
# Options: keychain (macOS), pass (Linux), env (fallback)
# storage: keychain

# Security level presets
# - relaxed: easy typing, longer expiry, softer lockout
# - balanced: recommended default
# - strict: longer code, tighter lockout
# - paranoid: strictest + hard parent termination on failed verify
# security_level: balanced

# Optional overrides (set only if you need custom tuning)
# Code expiry in seconds
# expiry: 300
# Code length in bytes
# code_length: 6
# Maximum failed verify attempts before lockout
# max_attempts: 3
# Failure behavior override
# - none: return FAILED and let caller enforce policy
# - terminate_parent: return FAILED, alert channel, and signal parent process
# fail_action: none

# Channel-specific settings can go here, but credentials
# should be stored in your OS secret store (Keychain/pass),
# NOT in this file. Run `ai2fa setup` to configure securely.
